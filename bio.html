<p>I was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland. Went to school in Deansrath Community College where I began to explore who i am as a Person. Today I am lucky to have friends and family who influences me to work hard everyday and hope to get closer to my goal. I have such an amazing teachers, professors and professional photographers who have open my horizons about the world of photography where life is like an open book of stories. Art is a form of abstract concept of what is beautiful behind that still image.

My current camera is Fuji XT3. I love taking it out and shoot everyday with it. The price was a bit too steep for me at the time but it was well worth the investment cossidering it is very ergonomic. For me it fits perfectly for on-the-go and just right for my small hands.
The type of lens that I used the most is 35mm 1.4 prime len. It is the most amazing len that I have ever shooting with. Small and compact. Very sharp glass to take multiple in-depth photos. Also I cannot forget to mention 18-55 mm zoom len for wide range of shots for landscape and close up portraits whenever I need a different to take a different approach </p>
