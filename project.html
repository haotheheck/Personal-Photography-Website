<h1>Project</h1>
	
	<p> As part of my project, I would like to work in a field where I can utilize my skills in creating contents for commercial.  A creative space where I feel comfortable producing online advertisement whilst getting paid to do it. Becoming graphic designers is not an easy route. A Portfolio dedicating to the work of graphic designers is a crucial component to show to the employer your work. To pursue this career, I must demonstrate a wide range of visual graphic materials to showcase my skills using creative tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom and Illustration. </p>

	
	<p> For this project, I will be producing the visual image using some of the brands that I find it very interesting as well as setting a high standard of quality. With this, I will be setting out at least 4 contents that work best. Demonstrating the style and techniques of my overall skills. </p>
