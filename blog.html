	<h2> Interview With the Professional </h2>
	<p>
	 		 	For this, I will be carrying out an interview with a professional in the field of IT company. Choosing this particular field is one of my daunting thoughts when pursuing this career. I have college experiences, projects and 3 years of Computer Science knowledge. I have a good level of programming experiences that vary between software testing, engineering, database and Web development. I know in my ability that I can be confident to apply it to the real world of work. However, there is a slight problem. I have never work in a professional industry before or even understand the experience of working in this particular field. With that being said, I have managed to reach out to a professional person who works in one of the biggest companies in the world called SAP. As a student soon to be graduate, I was very happy and glad to be able to have this option to ask him all the burning questions. His name is Gareth and he is happy to participate in it. Gareth does not like to be recorded for video or audio purposes so instead, he allowed me to be transcript it as his life is very private. 
	</p>

	<h3>Whats your job title?</h3>
	<p> - Support Engineer for the Product Support organisation of SAP</p>
	
	<h3>In your average day, whats your job like? </h3>
	<p> - It's hectic. The average day consists of handling customer tickets which includes systems analysis and research.
That is compounded with meetings, live chat coverage, queue management duties and various other extracirriculars which mean your calendar is quite packed.</p>
	
	<h3>How did you land this job?</h3>
	<p> - I had job email alerts enabled for SAP. I saw one come through that fit my skillset and applied. 3 interviews later I was invited to join. </p>
	
	<h3>What advices would you give to the graduates if we wanted to pursue in this field</h3>
	<p> - Be conscious of the proposed length of your training.
If a company wants you productive within a couple of weeks you'll likely be ill equipped to actually support the product. In this role it may be 2-3 months before you touch a customer ticket. Aside from this just be prepared to be constantly alert as its a role which never really stops.</p>
	
	<h3>what kind of skills do you think that is vital to this role </h3>
	<p> - A well rounded Computer Science background will go a long way in this role. There are a large number of different support teams handling different products,
from HANADB to Solution Manager to ERP to Cloud systems you don't know exactly what you'll be managing until you sit in your desk day one. Being able to easily adapt to new technologies is also fundamentally important as customer landscapes can get complex.
Obviously customer service skills are also a very important part of the role as you will be directly speaking to customers; this can be via ticket, email, chat or over Teams.</p>
	
	<h3>When you first got the job, what its like working for the company at early stage. From College experiences to work?</h3>
	<p>- It's a very different reality. Knowing that everything you learn will be important for your day to day as opposed to wondering if certain topics won't ever be examined will lead to a much stronger learning experience.
You find yourself actually enthusiastic about the learnings you are completing and know you'll be able to apply them in a productive manner. Aside from that the culture within a team is a lot less hostile than it can be in college. Teams don't (or shouldn't) have cliques formed within them and everyone dedicates themselves to helping each other no matter what. 
The health of the individual in the team directly affects the health of the team and this is not a concept that the every-man-for-themselves nature of college has. </p>
	<br>
	
	<h2> Verdict </h2>
	<p>Overall it was a very valuable information to get an insight of IT world of work and understand how the system operate within a big Company. Gareth have been a really good sport for providing me the contents that I have never really thought about it before. The individual skills such as Customer service, persistance and background knowledge of Computer Science can go a long way into doing a really good job at it. With this it will motivated me to push harder especially with more future solo projects to advance my knowledge of Computer Science.</p>

	<p>By now we all probably heard the Silicon Valley. The home of world-leading tech companies located in California of United State of America. Now in the 21st century, Ireland is the home of Silicon Valley of Europe and the main digital hub for most if not all tech giants. The Irish emerald at the time has gone through drastic changes over 50 years. The stories that we all hear about the old days seem too good to be true. Recurring over and over again the stories to be told by the different older generation. According to Newenham, high education levels and school dropout rates were high in Docklands. By 1997, only 10 percent of young adults who stick with secondary school were long enough to sit their leaving cert. Only a fraction of mere 1 percent of those who progressed on to third-level education.  With broken community ties, minimal investment, and many of those with ambition leaving the area. In those year, Unemployment was endemic, charting more than twice the national average. Illegal substances and criminal activities were booming. Docklands as we know today as the central tech hub used to be known as a no-go area zone (Newenham, p 32, 2015). Essentially, the reputation of the area had gone to dirt.  Not long during the year of 1997, Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) was soon established. They set out their project to completely replenish the area and securing a sustainable social, economic regeneration and improving the physical environment of Docklands.  Peter Coyne, who was Chief Executive for DDDA (1998-2005), says that in order for the project to be successful, it have to fundamentally change people mental map of Dublin by expanding their concept as well as encourage them to spend time in the area (Newenham, p 40, 2015). </p>
	
	<p>The result of it was a major successful and it was one of the starting points of changing the value of Docklands forever. DDDA have clean up and redeveloped Grand Canal Dock. Setting Grand Canal Square as the main focal point of attraction by developing hotels, bars, and restaurants. DDDA offers no special tax incentives for companies to relocated to Grand Canal Dock. Lastly, the Authority wanted to focus on creating opportunities for the next generation. In doing so they invested their fund in supplying the supports and staffs to the low-level education. Thus, the result was staggering remarkable. According to Newenham, by 2005 people who dropped out of school before the age of 15 had decreased from 65 to 30 percent. People who sat through the Leaving Certificate increased from 10 to 60 percent. Finally, the people who went to third level education, a mere 1 percent have increased to 10 percent. DDDA have really help change the community for the better of good (Newenham, p 47, 2015). On the other hand, one thing to remember the key moment of Ireland as the Silicon Valley of Europe is the Industrial Development Authority (IDA). They played an important role of changing the ideology of Ireland as we know it today. Without their plans and their vision, the evolution of Ireland as the tech hub has largely been due to the work of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, enticing Silicon Valley giants eastwards, and fostering the development of indigenous firms (Newenham, p 51, 2015). Intel, SAP, Google and Facebook were one of the first newcomer to initially set up their business here in Ireland. Soon after that the rest began to follow the tech giants footsteps and thus building the digital hub of Europe. </p>
	
	<p>This brings to my curiosity about the future of Ireland in 10 years. What are the skills demands that are needed in Ireland? According to the chart; Skills Forecast vs Graduate Level 8+ (2012 – 2018), the figures illustrated that in the space of 6 years between 2012 to 2018. It has shown a steady upward amongst the institutions of graduate with ICT skills. Whereas the demands for potential jobs have exceeded more than double the figure since 2012. That being said, having ICT skills to have the advantage of landing a job than most others is a bonus (Dept. Education, 2019). However, what kind of quality do the enterprises look for? With the help of the Interview that was conducted amongst 40 of enterprises participants. The result of the respond were; 1) Technology background knowledge is essential to effectively communicate and create solution for customers. 2) Industry experiences is the most favourable and the talent pool can be very competitive. 3)Programming can be shift various languages depending on what industry needs. 4) Doing a well-known certificate such as AWS Amazon, Cisco and Microsoft can have a higher chance of securing a job. 5) Lastly female are needed to balance the ICT Field (Expert Group, p 40 - p 66, 2019)</p>
	
	<p>Finally, my professional career development. The kind of career path that I have at the moment is very broad amongst the ICT field. With the help of my course (Media studies & Computer Science) through Maynooth University. I have learnt to code more than 5 different languages. I have gained the broad knowledge of computer science. Experiences in all creative media practices as known as Adobe suite. I have done projects involving my latest very own portfolio website and created a ‘Tungsten’ Cocktails app. These are the University experiences that I have gained from studying there as well as developing my very own skills within it. Without those ICT skills I could not have even compete the minimum requirement of entering the world of ICT field. From my personal professional growth, it is safe to say that I am more than ready to take on a challenge from the industry level. However, that is just being optimistic, as I have never worked in the industry before. Fortunately, I have conducted an interview with the professional who work in one of the biggest companies in Ireland called SAP. The participant was happy enough to sit down with me through online call and answers all the burning questions about what it like working in the real world of work.</p>
	
	<p>Safe to say the interview were expected within the industry standard as well as reassuring of transition myself to real world of work. The Participant answers were very helpful to my career path to ICT world. Some of key points were; 1) Upon starting a job, a person is given short months of training before actually applying it to the job. This was a sound of sweet lullaby to my ear as I always have a fear of imposter syndrome when I first started programming. A common problem by many of the developers who feel that they are not good enough.  2) Having a well-rounded computer science knowledge and customer service skills are vital in the world of ICT world. Technology is moving forward, so is the industries. As the participant was giving a valuable information, he explained that having those features will benefits in the long run as every day is a different day. Adapting new software or technologies is fundamentally important as customer landscapes can get complex. 3) The transition of college experiences to industrial experiences. This key point here was very wholesome for me to hear. The participant continues his last answer that the kind of working environment is completely different reality. He concluded that the preparation for college examination is way differ than how industry preparation is. What is so great about within the industry learning environment is that you find yourself enthusiastic about the learnings especially within the field that you are most interested in and of course apply it to the productive manner.  In addition to the working environment, as part of team within the industry levels. Every member are there to co-operate with each other to meet the deadline. In doing so, helping is one of the core values of pushing the boulder together to the top of the mountain. Whereas with college, some issues might arise where one person must carry the whole group project itself. Again, this was one of the best ways to get a better understanding of the real work before the next chapter. </p>
	
	<p>Moving over to the last segment. In my website, I have showcased all different kind of work I do outside of college as a hobby through Gallery and Portfolio. Photography and creative contents are where I am at my most zen space. Upon setting out my project, I have used the opportunity to create a visual reference work of my graphic design skills. Demonstrating the highest quality of my skills. Which bring me to my conclusion of where I stand right now. I am essentially just living my life every day. I acknowledged the demand of jobs and the competitiveness of within it. For that I am prepared for it. A technology job with creativity is where I strive the most. The strengths and weaknesses of mine have gradually change the more I started to notice the little things about myself. Having evidence of visibility of my own work really gives me the confident and motivation to continue to improve myself. For this I have no doubt of what the future will hold.</p>
